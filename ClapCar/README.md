The purpose of this project is to create a small, clap-controlled car. The car responds to claps as follows:

One clap: starts rotating to the right
Two claps: starts rotating to the left
Three claps: moves forward
If the car is moving (rotating or moving forward), a single clap will stop it. The car’s movement is indicated by LEDs:

Red LED: the car is stationary
Green LED: the car is moving
Yellow LED: indicates when a clap is detected.
