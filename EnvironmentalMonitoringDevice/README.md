# Enviromental Monitoring Device

This project involves creating an environmental monitoring device that displays key environmental parameters, including temperature, air pressure, altitude, and UV index, on an LCD screen. The device is equipped with a button that allows users to toggle between the different measurements, providing real-time feedback on the environment.

## Components Used
* Arduino Uno Rev3
* Analog UV Sensor (GUVA-S12SD)
* 16x2 LCD Display
* I2C bus for LCD Display (LCM1602)
* Pressure Sensor (BMP280)
* AC Adaptor (12V DC 500mA)
* 5.5mm DC Male Jack Connector
* 100kOhm Pull-Up Resistor
* Casing: A custom-built enclosure made from a junction box to house the components securely
