# Enviromental Monitoring Device

This project involves creating an environmental monitoring device that displays environmental parameters, including temperature, air pressure, altitude, and UV index, on an LCD screen. The device is equipped with a button that allows users to toggle between the different measurements, providing real-time feedback on the environment.
