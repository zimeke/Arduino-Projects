# Enviromental Monitoring Device

This project involves creating an environmental monitoring device that displays key environmental parameters, including temperature, air pressure, altitude, and UV index, on an LCD screen. The device is equipped with a button that allows users to toggle between the different measurements, providing real-time feedback on the environment.

## Components Used
* Arduino Uno Rev3
* Motor Driver (L298N)
* 2 x DC Motor (JGA25-370; 12V 12rpm variant)
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
* 5.5mm DC Male Jack Connector
* Casing: A custom-built enclosure made from a junction box to house the components securely
